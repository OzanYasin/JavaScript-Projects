#!/usr/bin/env node

// ! First things to do:
// ! Writing <npm link> on this project's directory terminal

// If you are on macOS or linux based operator system you need to run the code below:
// chmod +x index.js
// chmod +x on a file (your script) only means, that you'll make it executable.

// -----------------------------

// !! Big Issues !!

// 1) Need to detect if a file changes,
// 2) It would be nice to provide some help to users of our CLI tool,
// 3) Need to figure out how to execute some JS code from within a JS program.

console.log('hello');
